Resoluci√≥n

Angular Resolution

Resolution refers to the smallest angle that can be observed. In other word the ability to separate two closely spaced object into two individual things. You may think of this as clarity. Angular resolution is dependent upon the diameter of the observing instrument. When fully dark adapted the human eye has a pupil diameter of around 8 mm. Typical binoculars have lenses with a diameter of 50 mm. Telescopes have a large variety of diameter from 60 mm up to 10 meters.

The limiting angular resolution of the eye, a lens or telescope can be estimated using Dawes equation,

 

resolution in arc sec = 11.6/D, where D = diameter in cm of the objective lens.

 However, more practical limits are:

the human eye: can split binaries with separations of 700 or more arcsec,
7x50 binoculars: can split binaries with separations of 100 or more arcsec, and
a 20 cm or 8 inch telescope: on an excellent night can split binaries with separations as small as 1 arcsec.

Because we must observe through the Earth's atmosphere, which is full of turbulence it is no really practical to expect to view binary stars closer together than 1 arc second. This turbulence causes the image produced by a telescope to become blurred and to dance around or twinkle. Astronomers refer to this as "seeing". When the seeing is really bad, like after the passage of a strong cold front your unaided eye can detect the bad seeing conditions because the stars twinkle a lot.
